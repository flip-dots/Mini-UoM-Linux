# Mini-UoM-Linux

## TL;DR
This is a website I made for a group project in my foundation year in computer science at the University of Manchester that is based upon their own Linux distributions desktop environment. This website is basically its own little desktop environment where you can open documents, pictures, and videos.

## Goal
The original goal was to create a website to introduce potential computer science students to computer science and what its like being a student. Needless to say, I got a little bit over excited.
## Sources
In terms of the sources of everything, I programmed all of it except for the weather app in the Group Member Content folder. All the files are not mine except for the text files, there is a sources.txt document in the file explorer which explains in more detail.
## Instructions
To navigate the website, you navigate it like you would a normal Linux computer, useful diagrams, pictures, documents, and more are scattered about in the file explorer as well as a few easter eggs.
## Conclusion
This took about a week of solid work to produce but I think you will agree that it was worth it.
