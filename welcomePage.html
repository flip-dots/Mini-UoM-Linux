            <div class="welcomePageContent">

                This is a website I developed as a foundation year student at the University of Manchester in 2021 as part of a group project. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I (somewhat) continue to maintain it to this day because I made it quite early in my programming career and I feel it still holds up to this day, I am quite proud of it.

            </div>

        <div id="pageOne" class="welcomePage hidden">

            <div class="welcomePageTitle"> 
                What
            </div>

            <div class="welcomePageContent">

                The goal of the project was to create a website to help students new to the foundation year find documents, relevant material, and insight from current students.
                <br>
                <br>
                As I was already an experienced developer I wanted to push the limits to improve my skills and understanding, therefore I decided to develop a website which mimics the university's Linux distribution and embed documents, images, and videos into the file system.
                <br>
                <br>
                If group members had shown up to even a single meeting, or if the instructors had even glanced at my screen, or if the specification provided any guidance regarding user interface then this would not have happened.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

        <div id="pageTwo" class="welcomePage hidden">

            <div class="welcomePageTitle"> 
                How
            </div>

            <div class="welcomePageContent">

                Thousands of lines of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
                <br>
                <br>
                This website heavily applies the principles of object oriented programming to avoid it becoming an incomprehensible mess. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The programs that you see are other websites embedded in the main site and the main site handles the tricky things like window management, the taskbar, and other boring things. This means that other members could independently develop their own pages and more or less just put them in the file structure for them to be included in the site, if only they had bothered.

        <div id="pageThree" class="welcomePage hidden">

            <div class="welcomePageTitle"> 
                Explore
            </div>

            <div class="welcomePageContent">

                That's enough introduction from me, now go check out the site, it navigates more or less just like any Linux desktop, so go nuts.

                        Open the File Manager to navigate around the virtual file structure, view documents, open images, watch videos.

                        Drag windows around, put them side by side, overlay them, even resize them, it's all supported.
